# Innioasis-y1-rockbox-themes
A collection of Rockbox themes I made or modded for the Innioasis Y1. They come as is and you are free to modify them in any way you like.
As with most Rockbox themes, these themes may (or may not) require the [Rockbox font pack](https://www.rockbox.org/daily.shtml).

A theme for all the Neon Genesis Evangelion fans. This theme is a modification of Snarty by Simon Andén, which was based on SPAZZ by Chuck Lardo & Spinoffs SNAZZ/SNAZZ2 by Jihoon Kim and SNAZZY by Phil Graves. I used this theme to get familiar with Rockbox theming.
