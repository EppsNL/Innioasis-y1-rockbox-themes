# Innioasis-y1-rockbox-themes
A collection of Rockbox themes I made or modded for the Innioasis Y1. They come as is and you are free to modify them in any way you like. To download a theme, clone the repo or download the lastest zip file found in each theme folder.
As with most Rockbox themes, these themes may (or may not) require the [Rockbox font pack](https://www.rockbox.org/daily.shtml).

Future theme ideas:

A theme for all the Neon Genesis Evangelion fans. The first release had PU/peak meters, but these have been removed due a bug where peak meters cause the device to pause randomly while playing FLAC files. This theme is a modification of Snarty by Simon Andén, which was based on SPAZZ by Chuck Lardo & Spinoffs SNAZZ/SNAZZ2 by Jihoon Kim and SNAZZY by Phil Graves. I used this theme to get familiar with Rockbox theming. For this theme I merged the [KodeMono](https://github.com/isaozler/kode-mono) and [MPLUS2](https://github.com/coz-m/MPLUS_FONTS) fonts together to add support for katakana and hiragana.
